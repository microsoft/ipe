Integrity Policy Enforcement (IPE)
==================================

.. NOTE::

   This is the documentation for admins, system builders, or individuals
   attempting to use IPE. If you're looking for more developer-focused
   documentation about IPE please see Documentation/security/ipe.rst

Overview
--------

IPE is a Linux Security Module which takes a complimentary approach to
access control. Whereas existing mandatory access control mechanisms
base their decisions on labels and paths, IPE instead determines
whether or not an operation should be allowed based on immutable
security properties of the system component the operation is being
performed on.

IPE itself does not mandate how the security property should be
evaluated, but relies on an extensible set of external property providers
to evaluate the component. IPE makes its decision based on reference
values for the selected properties, specified in the IPE policy.

The reference values represent the value that the policy writer and the
local system administrator (based on the policy signature) trust for the
system to accomplish the desired tasks.

One such provider is for example dm-verity, which is able to represent
the integrity property of a partition (its immutable state) with a digest.

To enable IPE, ensure that ``CONFIG_SECURITY_IPE`` (under
:menuselection:`Security -> Integrity Policy Enforcement (IPE)`) config
option is enabled.

Use Cases
---------

IPE works best in fixed-function devices: devices in which their purpose
is clearly defined and not supposed to be changed (e.g. network firewall
device in a data center, an IoT device, etcetera), where all software and
configuration is built and provisioned by the system owner.

IPE is a long-way off for use in general-purpose computing: the Linux
community as a whole tends to follow a decentralized trust model (known as
the web of trust), which IPE has no support for it yet. Instead, IPE
supports PKI (public key infrastructure), which generally designates a
set of trusted entities that provide a measure of absolute trust.

Additionally, while most packages are signed today, the files inside
the packages (for instance, the executables), tend to be unsigned. This
makes it difficult to utilize IPE in systems where a package manager is
expected to be functional, without major changes to the package manager
and ecosystem behind it.

DIGLIM [#diglim]_ is a system that when combined with IPE, could be used to
enable and support general-purpose computing use cases.

Known Limitations
-----------------

IPE cannot verify the integrity of anonymous executable memory, such as
the trampolines created by gcc closures and libffi (<3.4.2), or JIT'd code.
Unfortunately, as this is dynamically generated code, there is no way
for IPE to ensure the integrity of this code to form a trust basis. In all
cases, the return result for these operations will be whatever the admin
configures as the ``DEFAULT`` action for ``EXECUTE``.

IPE cannot verify the integrity of programs written in interpreted
languages when these scripts are invoked by passing these program files
to the interpreter. This is because the way interpreters execute these
files; the scripts themselves are not evaluated as executable code
through one of IPE's hooks, but they are merely text files that are read
(as opposed to compiled executables) [#interpreters]_.

Threat Model
------------

The threat type addressed by IPE is tampering of executable userspace
code beyond the initially booted kernel, and the initial verification of
kernel modules that are loaded in userspace through ``modprobe`` or
``insmod``.

A bare-minimum example of a threat that should be mitigated by IPE, is
an untrusted (potentially malicious) binary that is downloaded and
bundled with all required dependencies (including a loader, libc, etc).
With IPE, this binary should not be allowed to be executed, not even any
of its dependencies.

Tampering violates integrity, yet lack of trust is caused by being
unable to detect tampering (and by extent verifying the integrity).
IPE's role in mitigating this threat is to verify the integrity (and
authenticity) of all executable code and to deny their use if they
cannot be trusted (as integrity verification fails, or the authorization
check fails against the reference value in the policy). IPE generates
audit logs which may be utilized to detect and analyze failures
resulting from policy violation.

Tampering threat scenarios include modification or replacement of
executable code by a range of actors including:

-  Actors with physical access to the hardware
-  Actors with local network access to the system
-  Actors with access to the deployment system
-  Compromised internal systems under external control
-  Malicious end users of the system
-  Compromised end users of the system
-  Remote (external) compromise of the system

IPE does not mitigate threats arising from malicious but authorized
developers (with access to a signing certificate), or compromised
developer tools used by them (i.e. return-oriented programming attacks).
Additionally, IPE draws hard security boundary between userspace and
kernelspace. As a result, IPE does not provide any protections against a
kernel level exploit, and a kernel-level exploit can disable or tamper
with IPE's protections.

Policy
------

IPE policy is a plain-text [#devdoc]_ policy composed of multiple statements
over several lines. There is one required line, at the top of the
policy, indicating the policy name, and the policy version, for
instance::

   policy_name=Ex_Policy policy_version=0.0.0

The policy name is a unique key identifying this policy in a human
readable name. This is used to create nodes under securityfs as well as
uniquely identify policies to deploy new policies vs update existing
policies.

The policy version indicates the current version of the policy (NOT the
policy syntax version). This is used to prevent rollback of policy to
potentially insecure previous versions of the policy.

The next portion of IPE policy are rules. Rules are formed by key=value
pairs, known as properties. IPE rules require two properties: ``action``,
which determines what IPE does when it encounters a match against the
rule, and ``op``, which determines when the rule should be evaluated.
The ordering is significant, a rule must start with ``op``, and end with
``action``. Thus, a minimal rule is::

   op=EXECUTE action=ALLOW

This example will allow any execution. Additional properties are used to
restrict attributes about the files being evaluated. These properties
are intended to be descriptions of systems within the kernel that can
provide a measure of integrity verification, such that IPE can determine
the trust of the resource based on the value of the property.

Rules are evaluated top-to-bottom. As a result, any revocation rules,
or denies should be placed early in the file to ensure that these rules
are evaluated before a rule with ``action=ALLOW``.

IPE policy supports comments. The character '#' will function as a
comment, ignoring all characters to the right of '#' until the newline.

The default behavior of IPE evaluations can also be expressed in policy,
through the ``DEFAULT`` statement. This can be done at a global level,
or a per-operation level::

   # Global
   DEFAULT action=ALLOW

   # Operation Specific
   DEFAULT op=EXECUTE action=ALLOW

A default must be set for all known operations in IPE. If you want to
preserve older policies being compatible with newer kernels that can introduce
new operations, set a global default of ``ALLOW``, then override the
defaults on a per-operation basis (as above).

With configurable policy-based LSMs, there's several issues with
enforcing the configurable policies at startup, around reading and
parsing the policy:

1. The kernel *should* not read files from userspace, so directly reading
   the policy file is prohibited.
2. The kernel command line has a character limit, and one kernel module
   should not reserve the entire character limit for its own
   configuration.
3. There are various boot loaders in the kernel ecosystem, so handing
   off a memory block would be costly to maintain.

As a result, IPE has addressed this problem through a concept of a "boot
policy". A boot policy is a minimal policy which is compiled into the
kernel. This policy is intended to get the system to a state where
userspace is set up and ready to receive commands, at which point a more
complex policy can be deployed via securityfs. The boot policy can be
specified via ``SECURITY_IPE_BOOT_POLICY`` config option, which accepts
a path to a plain-text version of the IPE policy to apply. This policy
will be compiled into the kernel. If not specified, IPE will be disabled
until a policy is deployed and activated through securityfs.

Deploying Policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Policies can be deployed from userspace through securityfs. These policies
are signed through the PKCS#7 message format to enforce some level of
authorization of the policies (prohibiting an attacker from gaining
unconstrained root, and deploying an "allow all" policy). These
policies must be signed by a certificate that chains to the
``SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYRING``. With openssl, the policy can be signed by::

   openssl smime -sign \
      -in "$MY_POLICY" \
      -signer "$MY_CERTIFICATE" \
      -inkey "$MY_PRIVATE_KEY" \
      -noattr \
      -nodetach \
      -nosmimecap \
      -outform der \
      -out "$MY_POLICY.p7b"

Deploying the policies is done through securityfs, through the
``new_policy`` node. To deploy a policy, simply cat the file into the
securityfs node::

   cat "$MY_POLICY.p7b" > /sys/kernel/security/ipe/new_policy

Upon success, this will create one subdirectory under
``/sys/kernel/security/ipe/policies/``. The subdirectory will be the
``policy_name`` field of the policy deployed, so for the example above,
the directory will be ``/sys/kernel/security/ipe/policies/Ex_Policy``.
Within this directory, there will be seven files: ``pkcs7``, ``policy``,
``name``, ``version``, ``active``, ``update``, and ``delete``.

The ``pkcs7`` file is read-only. Reading it returns the raw PKCS#7 data
that was provided to the kernel, representing the policy. If the policy being
read is the boot policy, this will return ``ENOENT``, as it is not signed.

The ``policy`` file is read only. Reading it returns the PKCS#7 inner
content of the policy, which will be the plain text policy.

The ``active`` file is used to set a policy as the currently active policy.
This file is rw, and accepts a value of ``"1"`` to set the policy as active.
Since only a single policy can be active at one time, all other policies
will be marked inactive. The policy being marked active must have a policy
version greater or equal to the currently-running version.

The ``update`` file is used to update a policy that is already present
in the kernel. This file is write-only and accepts a PKCS#7 signed
policy. Two checks will always be performed on this policy: First, the
``policy_names`` must match with the updated version and the existing
version. Second the updated policy must have a policy version greater than
or equal to the currently-running version. This is to prevent rollback attacks.

The ``delete`` file is used to remove a policy that is no longer needed.
This file is write-only and accepts a value of ``1`` to delete the policy.
On deletion, the securityfs node representing the policy will be removed.
However, delete the current active policy is not allowed and will return
an operation not permitted error.

Similarly, writing to both ``update`` and ``new_policy`` could result in
bad message(policy syntax error) or file exists error. The latter error happens
when trying to deploy a policy with a ``policy_name`` while the kernel already
has a deployed policy with the same ``policy_name``.

Deploying a policy will *not* cause IPE to start enforcing the policy. IPE will
only enforce the policy marked active. Note that only one policy can be active
at a time.

Once deployment is successful, the policy can be activated, by writing file
``/sys/kernel/security/ipe/$policy_name/active``.
For example, the ``Ex_Policy`` can be activated by::

   echo 1 > "/sys/kernel/security/ipe/Ex_Policy/active"

From above point on, ``Ex_Policy`` is now the enforced policy on the
system.

IPE also provides a way to delete policies. This can be done via the
``delete`` securityfs node, ``/sys/kernel/security/ipe/$policy_name/delete``.
Writing ``1`` to that file deletes the policy::

   echo 1 > "/sys/kernel/security/ipe/$policy_name/delete"

There is only one requirement to delete a policy: the policy being deleted
must be inactive.

.. NOTE::

   If a traditional MAC system is enabled (SELinux, apparmor, smack), all
   writes to ipe's securityfs nodes require ``CAP_MAC_ADMIN``.

Modes
~~~~~

IPE supports two modes of operation: permissive (similar to SELinux's
permissive mode) and enforced. In permissive mode, all events are
checked and policy violations are logged, but the policy is not really
enforced. This allows users to test policies before enforcing them.

The default mode is enforce, and can be changed via the kernel command
line parameter ``ipe.enforce=(0|1)``, or the securityfs node
``/sys/kernel/security/ipe/enforce``.

.. NOTE::

   If a traditional MAC system is enabled (SELinux, apparmor, smack, etcetera),
   all writes to ipe's securityfs nodes require ``CAP_MAC_ADMIN``.

This event indicates that IPE made an access control decision; the IPE
specific record (1420) is always emitted in conjunction with a
``AUDITSYSCALL`` record.

Determining whether IPE is in permissive or enforced mode can be derived
from ``success`` property and exit code of the ``AUDITSYSCALL`` record.

This event indicates that IPE switched the active poliy from one to another
along with the version and the hash digest of the two policies.
Note IPE can only have one policy active at a time, all access decision
evaluation is based on the current active policy.
The normal procedure to deploy a new policy is loading the policy to deploy
into the kernel first, then switch the active policy to it.

This record will always be emitted in conjunction with a ``AUDITSYSCALL`` record for the ``write`` syscall.

Success Auditing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IPE supports success auditing. When enabled, all events that pass IPE
policy and are not blocked will emit an audit event. This is disabled by
default, and can be enabled via the kernel command line
``ipe.success_audit=(0|1)`` or
``/sys/kernel/security/ipe/success_audit`` securityfs file.

This is *very* noisy, as IPE will check every userspace binary on the
system, but is useful for debugging policies.

.. NOTE::

   If a traditional MAC system is enabled (SELinux, apparmor, smack, etcetera),
   all writes to ipe's securityfs nodes require ``CAP_MAC_ADMIN``.

Properties
----------

As explained above, IPE properties are ``key=value`` pairs expressed in
IPE policy. Two properties are built-into the policy parser: 'op' and
'action'. The other properties are deterministic attributes to express
across files. Currently those properties are: '``boot_verified``',
'``dmverity_signature``', '``dmverity_roothash``', '``fsverity_signature``',
'``fsverity_digest``'. A description of all properties supported by IPE
are listed below:

op
~~

Indicates the operation for a rule to apply to. Must be in every rule,
as the first token. IPE supports the following operations:

   ``EXECUTE``

      Pertains to any file attempting to be executed, or loaded as an
      executable.

   ``FIRMWARE``:

      Pertains to firmware being loaded via the firmware_class interface.
      This covers both the preallocated buffer and the firmware file
      itself.

   ``KMODULE``:

      Pertains to loading kernel modules via ``modprobe`` or ``insmod``.

   ``KEXEC_IMAGE``:

      Pertains to kernel images loading via ``kexec``.

   ``KEXEC_INITRAMFS``

      Pertains to initrd images loading via ``kexec --initrd``.

   ``POLICY``:

      Controls loading policies via reading a kernel-space initiated read.

      An example of such is loading IMA policies by writing the path
      to the policy file to ``$securityfs/ima/policy``

   ``X509_CERT``:

      Controls loading IMA certificates through the Kconfigs,
      ``CONFIG_IMA_X509_PATH`` and ``CONFIG_EVM_X509_PATH``.

action
~~~~~~

   Determines what IPE should do when a rule matches. Must be in every
   rule, as the final clause. Can be one of:

   ``ALLOW``:

      If the rule matches, explicitly allow access to the resource to proceed
      without executing any more rules.

   ``DENY``:

      If the rule matches, explicitly prohibit access to the resource to
      proceed without executing any more rules.

boot_verified
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This property can be utilized for authorization of files from initramfs.
   The format of this property is::

         boot_verified=(TRUE|FALSE)


   .. WARNING::

      This property will trust files from initramfs(rootfs). It should
      only be used during early booting stage. Before mounting the real
      rootfs on top of the initramfs, initramfs
      script will recursively remove all files and directories on the
      initramfs. This is typically implemented by using switch_root(8) [#switch_root]_.
      Therefore the initramfs will be empty and not accessible after the real
      rootfs takes over. It is advised to switch to a different policy
      that doesn't rely on the property after this point.
      This ensures that the trust policies remain relevant and effective
      throughout the system's operation.

dmverity_roothash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This property can be utilized for authorization or revocation of
   specific dm-verity volumes, identified via sroot hash. It has a
   dependency on the DM_VERITY module. This property is controlled by
   the ``IPE_PROP_DM_VERITY`` config option, it will be automatically
   selected when ``IPE_SECURITY`` , ``DM_VERITY`` and
   ``DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG`` are all enabled.
   The format of this property is::

      dmverity_roothash=DigestName:HexadecimalString

   The supported DigestNames for dmverity_roothash are [#dmveritydigests]_ [#securedigest]_ :

      + blake2b-512
      + blake2s-256
      + sha1
      + sha256
      + sha384
      + sha512
      + sha3-224
      + sha3-256
      + sha3-384
      + sha3-512
      + md4
      + md5
      + sm3
      + rmd160

dmverity_signature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This property can be utilized for authorization of all dm-verity
   volumes that have a signed roothash that chains to a keyring
   specified by dm-verity's configuration, either the system trusted
   keyring, or the secondary keyring. It depends on
   ``DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG`` config option and is controlled by
   the ``IPE_PROP_DM_VERITY`` config option, it will be automatically
   selected when ``IPE_SECURITY``, ``DM_VERITY`` and
   ``DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG`` are all enabled.
   The format of this property is::

      dmverity_signature=(TRUE|FALSE)

fsverity_digest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This property can be utilized for authorization or revocation of
   specific fsverity enabled file, identified via its fsverity digest.
   It depends on ``FS_VERITY`` config option and is controlled by
   ``CONFIG_IPE_PROP_FS_VERITY``. The format of this property is::

      fsverity_digest=DigestName:HexadecimalString

   The supported DigestNames for fsverity_roothash are [#fsveritydigest]_ [#securedigest]_ :

      + sha256
      + sha512

fsverity_signature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This property can be utilized for authorization of all fsverity
   enabled files that is verified by fsverity. The keyring that the
   signature is verified against is subject to fsverity's configuration,
   typically the fsverity keyring. It depends on
   ``CONFIG_FS_VERITY_BUILTIN_SIGNATURES`` and  it is controlled by
   the Kconfig ``CONFIG_IPE_PROP_FS_VERITY``. The format of this
   property is::

      fsverity_signature=(TRUE|FALSE)

FAQ
---

Q:
   What's the difference between other LSMs which provide a measure of
   trust-based access control?

A:

   In general, there's two other LSMs that can provide similar functionality:
   IMA, and Loadpin.

   IMA and IPE are functionally very similar. The significant difference between
   the two is the policy. [#devdoc]_

   Loadpin and IPE differ fairly dramatically, as Loadpin only covers the IPE's
   kernel read operations, whereas IPE is capable of controlling execution
   on top of kernel read. The trust model is also different; Loadpin roots its
   trust in the initial super-block, whereas trust in IPE is stemmed from kernel
   itself (via ``SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS``).
